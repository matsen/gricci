    # y is min[1, (g(y -> x) / g(x -> y))] In our case, g(y -> x) = 1/d(y) and
    # g(x -> y) = 1/d(x) giving MH ratio min[1, d(y) / d(x)]. The amount of
    # mass moving from x to a neighboring y is min[1, d(y) / d(x)] / d(x). We
    # can then keep things integral by multiplying by d(x)^2, such that mass
    # movement is min[d(x), d(y)], and the amount of mass that stays put is
