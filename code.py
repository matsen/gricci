    Calculate the coarse Ollivier-Ricci curvature for vertices source and
    target of graph g. There are two options: lazy_unif and unif_prior_mh.

    Under `lazy_unif`, we use the lazy random walk with probability of movement
    pm=pm1/pm2 (expressed as rational to keep results rational).
    The results are reported in an ordered tuple including entries `kappa`,
    which is the coarse Ricci curvature as defined in Ollivier (2009), and
    `ric`, which is kappa divided by pm. This normalized version only depends
    on the graph.

    Under `unif_prior_mh`, we use the the Metropolis-Hastings setup for the
    uniform prior on nodes. There are no free parameters, so in this case we
    just take `ric` to be `kappa`.

    # movement is min[d(x), d(y)], and the amount of mass that stays put is
