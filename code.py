    Calculate the Ollivier-Ricci curvature for vertices source and target of
    graph g under the standard lazy random walk with probability of movement

    The results are reported in an ordered tuple including entries 'kappa',

    'ric', which is kappa divided by pm. This normalized version only depends
    on the graph.
